# ShaderBox

Experimental project that I created while following the WebGL tutorial.

## Why?

I want to know how to draw on the screen. I know how to do that using OpenGL but it's no longer a go-to solution when it comes to drawing stuff, so I had to learn some newer technologies in order to draw the same ugly & static stuff with more frames & coolness.

Eventually the goal is... well, I have been dreaming about making a small game engine to play with whenever I have some "game idea" on my mind. There's already lots of cool engines out there, I already know Unity but they are not as cool to use as I hope they'd be. Mine is going to be a lot worse for sure, but I dreamed a lot to convience myself that it's going to be great!

## Why?

I needed an excuse to dig deeper into Rust - the language that I have been having a weird love & hate relationship at the same time. I never gave it a good chance to see if I would really like it, or it's just FOMO that makes it attractive to me. I always used to create weird stuff with languages I am learning, and rust is not going to be any different. For example, last time I wrote an interpreter to learn Golang, to be honest now that I am more _experienced_ with the language, I don't feel good when I check out the source code and see all the panics and recovers. However, we gotta start somewehere and I am not doubting it.
